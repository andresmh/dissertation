Derivativeness 

This is a script that compares two projects.
It is a 'diff' of sorts.
Each row in each table of the represents a version of a Scratch project (see anatomy).
This process compares all the projects that are remixes against the projects they are based on. 
The 
and their original projects on  and put the results into a database table.  

The id's of the pairs are project_info.id and projects_info.based_on_project_id. You will ignore the id's of those where projects_info.based_on_project id are null because it means that those are not remixes (but they could be original projects on which remixes are based).

Here is the structure of the database:

Here is a very simple/inefficient PHP-based comparer: http://j.mp/rfT42S

The script should run on Linux (CentOS). The scrip should create and populate a table with the following fields:

-remix_pid
-original_pid
-language
-stacks_diff_including_params: difference in number of words
-stacks_diff_excluding_params: ditto
-original_stacks_word_count: useful to understand put the diff in perspective
-humanstacks_diff_including_params: ditto
-humanstacks_diff_excluding_params: ditto
-original_stacks_word_count
-blocks_count_diff: total blocks in the remix - total blocks in original
-original_block_count
-sprite_counts_diff: total sprites in the remix - total sprites in original
-original_sprite_count
-image_count_diff: total images in remix - total images in original
-original_image_count
-For each sprite, look at their images and compare them.
-images_bytes_diff: total bytes difference
-original_images_total_bytes: sum of all bytes in the original
-sound_count_diff: total sounds in remix - total sounds in original
-original_sound_count
-For each sprite, look at their sounds and compare them.
-sounds_bytes_diff: total bytes difference
-original_sounds_total_bytes: sum of all bytes in the original
-comment_strings_difference: count number of characters that are different
-original_comment_strings_total: in characters
-say_strings_difference: in characters
-original_say_strings_total in characters
...the same for say, think, broadcast, variable_name, variable_value, list_name,  list_value
-strings_removed
-remix_version
-parent_version
