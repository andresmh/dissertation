Process for comparing remixes to the original across six dimensions


Media Computation Remix

Divided the problem into smaller pieces inspired by the idea of Media Computation \cite{guzdial}

Digital Media Creation:
* Media. Sensory.
	* YoTube, deviantArt, most of UGC sites
* Computation. Algorithmical
	* GitHub? SouceForge

Scratch is at the intersection and as such software reuse is not enough and neither it is media reuse. 
We need both.

Measuring Remixing

Dividing into media and computation. 

Computation (Behavior)
* Blocks
* Scripts
* Parameters

Presentation (Media)

* Images
* Sounds
* Text

Process for calculating amount of reuse Inspired by literature on software reuse \cite{farkes_terry} 

Derivativeness = amount of reused stuff  / amount of total new stuff

But Derivativeness does not account for removal.

Oriignality = new stuff + removed stuff / total Can be higher than 1

Examples:

*Chalkmarrow 950096
* Necklace
* Tetris




% FOR ATTITUDINAL DISCUSSION
% What is better? To change the media or to change the computation. 
%Depends on the creator. 
%Some creators lean more on the media-creation side of the spectrum while others lean more on the computational side.
% other are computational-creators.
